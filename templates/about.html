        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            For the last few years I've been working as a <span>freelance musician</span>,
            working for two of the oldest cruise companies based in the UK, 
            Cunard and P&O. As a trombonist, I was a member of the ballroom and latin dance band
            for two years, until transitioning to the theatre. I now work as a
            member of the Royal Court theatre band on all three of Cunard's ships
            including the last remaining ocean liner in the world - Queen Mary 2.

            Growing up, I learned brass instruments from an early age, and went on
            to study at the <span>Royal Northern College of Music</span> in Manchester, UK.
            Although health reasons forced me to eventually drop out, I still
            thoroughly enjoyed my time at the College and learned a huge amount from
            some of the most brilliant musicians in the world.
        </p>

            A few years later, I ended up studying a course at Manchester's
            <span>School of Sound Recording</span> (now Spirit Studios). I learned a huge amount
            about engineering sound in Recording Studios and for Television and Film.

            I've used many of the skills I've learned to upload music, sound effects 
            and video to <span>HitRECord</span> - an online production company ran 
            by <span>Joseph Gordon Levitt</span>, and have featured in some amazing work including
            an LG Television Advert, a Youtube Original series and also a 
            Netflix promotional video.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my spare time, I'm an amateur photographer, and I also love football 
            <span>#Upthetics #wafc</span>, gaming and television/film.
