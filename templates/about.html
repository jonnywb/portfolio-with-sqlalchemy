        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            For the last few years I've been working as a freelance Musician,
            working for two of the oldest cruise companies based in the UK, 
            Cunard and P&O. As a trombonist, I was a member of the ballroom and latin dance band
            for two years, until transitioning to the theatre. I now work as a
            member of the Royal Court theatre band on all three of Cunard's ships
            including the last remaining ocean liner in the world - Queen Mary 2.

            Growing up, I learned brass instruments from an early age, and went on
            to study at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, UK.
            Although health reasons forced me to eventually drop out, I still
            thoroughly enjoyed my time at the College and learned a huge amount from
            some of the most brilliant musicians in the world.

            A few years later, I ended up studying a course at Manchester's
            School of Sound Recording (now Spirit Studios). I learned a huge amount
            about engineering sound in Recording Studios and for Television and Film.

            I've used many of the skills I've learned to upload music, sound effects 
            and video to <span>HitRECord</span> - an online production company ran 
            by Joseph Gordon Levitt, and have featured in some amazing work including
            an LG Television Advert, a Youtube Original series and also a 
            Netflix promotional video.

            In my spare time, I love photography, football <span>#Upthetics #wafc</span>,
            gaming and television/film. You can see my photography by visiting the instagram 
            link at the bottom of the page.
