### Treehouse Python Techdegree Unit 5 Project

> Create an interface for a portfolio web application. The main (index) page lists your projects including the project title and short description. Each project links to a detail page that displays the title, date, and description.

> The application lets the user add or edit project information. When adding or editing a project, the application prompts the user for title, date, skills, description, and a link to a repo. The results for these entries are stored in a database and displayed on the homepage. The HTML/CSS for this site has been supplied for you.

#### How to Run:

1. Download the files using Github
2. Install python
3. Create a virtual environment.
4. Install any required files (see requirements.txt)
5. Run app.py from the terminal.

#### What I learned:

This was my favourite project because it brought everything that I
have been learning during this course together, and helped me to see how python, sqlalchemy, SQLite, flask and jinja can be used in conjunction with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
